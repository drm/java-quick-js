# java-quickjs-jni

This provides a Java Native Interface (JNI) to
[QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/). 

## Preliminary testing results

Overall, this library seems to outperform [mv8](https://github.com/drm/mv8) by
a longshot, for one-off render calls, which is the primary concern of the mv8
implementation too. So, just to be able to render React components server-side,
this library seems to be the way to go.

## Usage
