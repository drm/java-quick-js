# java-quickjs-jni

This provides a Java Native Interface (JNI) to
[QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/). 

## Preliminary testing results

Overall, this library seems to outperform [mv8](https://github.com/drm/mv8) by
a longshot. In combination with the developer experience, I am quite likely
going to replace all my mv8 implementations with this one.

## Usage
